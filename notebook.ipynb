Or are they simply capable of identifying statistical patterns without any clear link to the underlying physics? Furner et al. (2022) run a sensitivity analysis of a regression-based ocean temperature model, trained against simulations from a 3D ocean model setup, demostrating that regression models are capable of learning much of the physics of the underlying system.\n",

    "Interestingly, this regressor shows some regions (the deep water in the south of the domain) where the errors are notably improved in a regressor using only 2D information. In this work, we have developed a regressor which learns one equation to be applied across all grid boxes in the domain. We optimize for best performance averaged over all relevant grid cells, but this does not enforce the best possible performance over each individual grid point/region, and so some of the resultant models will favor certain types of dynamics more than others. Given this, it is not unexpected that the new equations discovered for the withholding experiments (which again optimize for best performance averaged over the entire domain interior) may outperform the control in some locations, despite being poorer overall. Here, we see that the control model is able to perform well across the domain, and optimizes for good performance overall, rather than the much more varied performance seen in the withholding experiments. It seems that as the model which withholds vertical information is not capable of performing well in many regions of the domain, a solution is found which highly optimizes performance in other regions to minimize error overall."

    "The horizontal (U and V) components of the currents directly drive horizontal advection of temperature. They are also indirectly related to horizontal diffusion, as this is increased in regions of high currents and steep gradients. As such, we would expect that suppressing information about the horizontal currents would cause increases in error in regions where horizontal advection and horizontal diffusion is high. However, again, we note that this region of increased error is one where many processes are present, and the increased errors seen also coincide, to a lesser extent, with regions of high vertical processes (advection, diffusion, and convection), which is less in line with our physical understanding. Here, errors appear more closely matched to the horizontal processes, and so a reasonable interpretation is that the model here is behaving as expected."

    "## Summary\n",
    "* There has been much recent interest in developing data-driven models for weather and climate predictions. However, there are open questions regarding their generalizability and robustness, highlighting a need to better understand how they make their predictions. In particular, it is important to understand whether data-driven models learn the underlying physics of the system against which they are trained, or simply identify statistical patterns without any clear link to the underlying physics. \n",
    "* In this notebook, we run a sensitivity analysis of a regression-based model of ocean temperature, trained against simulations from a 3D ocean model setup in a very simple configuration. \n",
    "* We show that the regressor heavily bases its forecasts on, and is dependent on, variables known to be key to the physics such as currents and density. By contrast, the regressor does not make heavy use of inputs such as location, which have limited direct physical impacts. \n",
    "* The model requires nonlinear interactions between inputs in order to show any meaningful skill—in line with the highly nonlinear dynamics of the ocean. Further analysis interprets the ways certain variables are used by the regression model. \n",
    "* We see that information about the vertical profile of the water column reduces errors in regions of convective activity, and information about the currents reduces errors in regions dominated by advective processes. \n",
    "* Our results demonstrate that even a simple regression model is capable of learning much of the physics of the system being modeled. We expect that a similar sensitivity analysis could be usefully applied to more complex ocean configurations."
